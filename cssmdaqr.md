# Media Queries in CSS

## Responsive Design

We as website designers are expected to create websites that will deliver optimum user experience for any device that may be used to access the webpage.

The media queries allow us to determine the type of media (screen, printer, speech etc.), size and some capabilities of the media.


### Standard Media Sizes for Screens

Standard screen sizes for responsive designs

* 320px or 480px (for mobile phones), 
* 768px (for tablets), and 
* 1024px (for small screens, laptops)
* 1920px (for FHD screen computers)
